description: Accessibility refers to how people with disabilities can meaningfully use products, websites, and services in the same (or as close to similar as possible) manner as people without disabilities. When engineers create pages, features, and interaction-heavy interfaces for the web, they are often geared towards people who use a traditional keyboard, mouse, and monitor. This course introduces engineers to how they can create more accessible and usable products.
