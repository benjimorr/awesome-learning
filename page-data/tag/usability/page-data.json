When engineers create pages, features, and interaction-heavy interfaces for the web, they are often geared towards people who use a traditional keyboard, mouse, and monitor. This course introduces engineers to how they can create more accessible and usable products."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/courses/Solid/","categorySlug":"/category/object-oriented-design/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"SOLID Principles","category":"Object-Oriented Design","description":"Familiarize yourself with the SOLID Design Principles and put them into practice. In the first lesson, walk through a conversational multiple-choice \"quiz\" (great for absolute beginners), and in the second, rewrite principle-violating code in line with the principles. This course assumes you have basic familiarity with Java, though by no means an expert understanding."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Usability","currentPage":0,"coursesLimit":10,"coursesOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/tag/usability","nextPagePath":"/tag/usability/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["784018950"]}
